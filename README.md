Taking output from a dummy business' Microsoft Access customer database, wrote scripts that use the Google Maps API to geocode customers' addresses. Used the total amount that each customer had spent at the business to weight each coordinate and calculate a weighted mean center. Created a heatmap with all of this information and plotted the weighted mean center with a marker. Potential application for a business: If a business needed to change locations or add a new location, they could use this program to figure out where an optimal new location would be.

Note: Planning to combine scripts to eliminate the need for text files (currently a few are created; I only included the example text file generated by Access). Also planning to add more functionality to increase potential benefit for businesses.
