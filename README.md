Note 2/15/19: Planning to combine scripts to eliminate the need for text files (currently a few are created; I only included the example text file generated by Access). Could add more functionality to increase potential benefit for businesses. Finally, host it online with HTML form to let users upload a `importedAddresses.txt` file and produce the heatmap in-browser.

Taking output from a dummy business' Microsoft Access customer database, wrote scripts that use the Google Maps API to geocode customers' addresses. Used the total amount that each customer had spent at the business to weight each coordinate and calculate a weighted mean center. Created a heatmap with all of this information and plotted the weighted mean center with a marker. Potential application for a business: If a business needed to change locations or add a new location, they could use this program to figure out where an optimal new location would be.

First, make sure python3 is installed. Then, run `pip3 install geopy`. Then `python3 addresses.py`. Then `python3 weightedmeancenter.py`. Then `python3 formatCoordinates.py`. Then open heatmap.html to see the data all plotted! If you want to produce this data for a different dataset you must pass in a different `importedAddresses.txt` than the one containing Berkeley addresses that I used. Please make sure the formatting is the same.
